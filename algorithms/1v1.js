// USER STORY
// when user enters a game record, they input opponent and final score,
// then both user and opponent get updated rating and game is recorded
// in their histories

// App steps:
// 1. Get Input
//    a. User's Data
//    b. Opponent's Data
//    c. Final score
// 2. Compute and Deliver Output
//    a. User's New Rating
//    b. Opponent's New Rating
//    c. Game record
//

// This data is calculated when user posts final score and opponent
// Lines 19 - 42 is just example data - this will be different for every game

  playerScore: 1, // calculated in post request (winner receives 1 point)
  opponentScore: 0 // calculated in post request (loser receives 0 points)
};

// After receiving above data, we can access below data from database

// After receiving the above three data points (objects), we can calculate
// the new ratings.
